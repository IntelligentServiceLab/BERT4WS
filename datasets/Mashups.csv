Image Upscaler,ImageFly,"Image Upscaler - https://imageupscaler.com - is a smart tool to upscale image without losing quality. When we work with image enlargement we usually meet problems with creating new pixels that have been added. Standard approach gives a blur effect in the image, if we estimate pixels as average of neighbouring pixels. And in that case the image looks like a stretched image and it has a blur effect. In the approach on Image Upscaler website we use Deep Learning GAN - generative adversarial network to approximate pixels. In this approach images save their quality, they have no blur effect and look more natural like in the real world if you take photos with a better camera or with smaller distance. At the first stage, GAN Generative Adversarial Networks have been trained on high photo databases. It helps the algorithm to understand how the natural object looks in real life. When you upload an image, AI Image Upscaler scans it, and generates new pixels for bigger images, and these pixels look like they should be in the real world. As a result, you get a higher resolution image.
You can upscale images in JPG, JPEG, PNG formats. Image Upscaler works with any image, but you will get a better result using photos that were not previously blurred or upscaled. The website shows better results on anime, logos, cartoon pictures, or any other synthesized image.",Images###Optimization,Web,Image Upscaler,3,Marcelo-Petrucelli###Roger-Medina###Randolphturpin,07.08.2021

UPCZilla,Amazon Product Advertising###eBay Product Services###Commission Junction,"UPCZilla is a search engine for UPCs (universal product codes), based on the Storeminator (https://www.programmableweb.com/mashup/storeminator) mashup code. It leverages the web services of Amazon, eBay and Commission Junction to search for likely matches for UPCs and then aggregates the resulting data, displaying it in the form of a price comparison listing, lowest price first.
The engine runs as a Wordpress plugin for ease of deployment and employs multiple layers of caching (database and flat-file HTML) to maximize site speed. However, most page refreshes will require cached data to be refetched from one or more web service - maximum cache time is between one hour and 12 hours, due to restrictions on caching imposed by web service providers.
Still, the results are very consistent, only limited by the accuracy of UPC data provided by third parties - at an estimate, less than 1% of UPC searches have products with wrongly-allocated UPCs.",Comparisons###Prices###Products,Web,UPCZilla.com,5,Ryan-Vanderberry###Craig-Rubino###ranker###Hartmarken###Leonardturpin,05.16.2017

Geo Location Atlas,Flickr###Twitter###Nokia Maps###Foursquare###Weather Underground (Wunderground)###Quova###Vine###Paperboy,"http://www.oraphp.com - Geo Location Atlas.
Once visited, you can see nice OVI map of place based on ISP of yours with clickable foursquare places to explore.
Plus current weather and forecast displayed.
If the location is urban you can have a lot of local online newspapers links under the map.
Just below are latest tweets from location (refresh works too) as well as located news feed from google.
Little magic thing happens when a place name (or address/city) entered instead of detected IP.
For example Sherlock Holmes Museum - to see what's up at Baker Street -&gt; OK.
Know the place and want to refresh memories? Or wanna check views of where never was before?
Look, geo photos from flickr on the right...
Click for the picture full details or browse for next.
Previous tweets from specified location (as far as available) are reachable.
These tweets location radius is adjustable as well (to investigate the exact place or wider range).
One more cool feature is you can refine tweets within that radius for specific search words.
For instance, to locate tweets with photos from these geotagged scope just enter word (at bottom left) photo -&gt; click search within!
Well, links on these photos (usually from fb, instagram, twitter, tumblr and others) are clickable...
Hm... looking for ... what if to enter instagram cats -&gt; search within?
What are (they tweeting about) recent news in newspapers ... ok, let's check nytimes -&gt; search within!
More results? Just click Radius+ to increase search area...
Still using google search? Better use (twitter geo powered) search within!
BTW, how about vine.co twitter videos from the place? Sure, click THE VINES to watch it playlisted...
Under tweets feel free to check what's top on Amazon by random category (at the moment from 10 available global locations)!
Just under Random Pics spoiler are random space cats pics (for your pleasure).",Mapping###Location###Photos###Search###Tweets###Weather,Web,,11,Randolphturpin###FeeArk###KG.Guna###3DPrintler###giangk49###arbin1###aqeelanjum90###mooody###Himmat###mashoodo###AnalPoet,10.01.2013

Nationally, there were 124 million ED visits in 2011, of which the CDC estimates 50% could be handled in a primary care setting. With an average charge for each ED encounter approaching $700 vs. the average physician office charge of $150, every patient redirected away from the ED saves the payor $550. This represents a total potential market savings of $34 billion for facilitating correct use of primary care.
Providing people with the tools they need to find appropriate care everywhere saves everyone, hospitals and patients, money and time.
Patients receive a SMS from triage.me post emergency room discharge. By sending a text to triage.me with their problem and current address, we route the person towards the nearest clinic, providing the address and a link to directions (for smartphone users).
Many clinics that work with the underinsured also often have variable hours and locations.
